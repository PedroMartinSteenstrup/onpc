# Enhanced Music Controller

*Enhanced AVR controller: listen to music properly!*

This app allows remote control of a Network Player or a Network A/V Receiver via the local network.
The app supports Onkyo/Pioneer/Integra released in April 2016 or later and Denon/Marantz with build-in HEOS technology.
Some TEAC models like Teac NT-503 are also supported.

This "Premium" version implements exactly the same receiver control functionality as the free version, but has some additional features:
- It is available for all desktop systems (Linux, Windows, macOS). 
- The Windows version allows to define global shortcuts for volume and playback control.
- It allows to rename input channels for older Onkyo/Pioneer models that do not support this feature in the firmware.
- It allows to reorder the play queue using drag-and-drop, change the font and buttons size and show/hide/reorder all control elements for all tabs.
- Android version allows to create home screen widgets.
